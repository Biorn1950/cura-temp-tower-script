# cura-temp-tower-script

Copy TempTower.py into your cura directory like the following;

C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.1\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts

This script is based on some variations I found on Thingiverse.

Four settings are available;

1. Start Height
2. Start Temperature
3. Height Increment
4. Temperature Increment

So, if you have a tower with a base layer 1.5mm thick and goes down from 260* (base) to 220* (top) in steps of 5* every 10mm, set:

* Start height: 1.5 mm
* Start Temperature 260 *C
* Height Increment 10 mm
* Temperature Increment -5 *C
